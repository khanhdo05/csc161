Tests:

A. TEST BASIC OPERATION

3. Test negative number during add - "How many would you like?"
This test checks to make sure that the program prints an error message and prompts the user to enter a valid number when user input a negative number.
This test will also make sure that when lookup or print, the count of the item is correctly recorded (not the negative one).
