Monday
A.
1. When we compile two files into farm, and run it, output would be: 
“Welcome to…
…
        Please enjoy”
        It would also print ten times “cluck”
2. We got an error message that implicit declaration of function is invalid.
3. Fixed with writing function prototypes into the farm.c file
B.
1. chicken.h
2. #include “chicken.h”
3. It worked!
4. We don’t have to add chicken.h to the clang command because it is included in both farm.c and chicken.c
C.
1. Done!
2. Done!
3. Done!
4. It worked!
D.
1. Done!
2. Done!
3. Done!
4. This doesn’t not work, as expected.
E.
1. Because make_sound is in util,h but util.h is included in both chicken.c and cow.c
2. Done!
3. This doesn’t fix the error.
4. It worked!
5. Done!


Wednesday
A.
1. Makefile file. Done!
2. Prediction: It doesn’t run the recipe because the target is ahead of the prerequisite.
        Result: it prints “‘farm’ is up to date”
3. Prediction: It run the recipe because one of the source files in the prerequisite is updated. 
Result: Just as predicted, it runs the recipe
4. Prediction: Throw an error.
Result: It does throw an error
5. We did got a compiler error!


B. 
1. Done!
2. Done!

4. Done!


C. 
1. Done!
2. Done!
3. Done!


D. 
1. Which files will your existing Makefile recompile if you edit just sheep.c? Which files must be recompiled if you edit sheep.c?
