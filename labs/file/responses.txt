Lab Report Week 8
Group: Khanh Do. Aaron Cannon


Monday


A.
1. Prediction:
First 3 characters in each array
        First: Col
        Second: Wor
        Third: Com
        Fourth: Not sure, fourth is a memory address (Correct: Wor)
        Fifth: Not sure, fifth is a memory address (Correct: Hel)
Variable addresses and array base addresses
        Not sure how we would know what the address looks like (Correct: variabl addresses and array base addresses are the same)
Variables printed as strings
        First: Cold
        Second: World
        Third: Computer Science (Result is Computer SciencepWorld because when we initialize third, we need to leave 17 bits of space to store the null character)
        Fourth: World
        Fifth: Hello
2. Prediction: Only print the first 3 characters
Correct but the fifth one doesn’t change because it’s not being modified.
3. Prediction: We can’t reference index of a pointer, and we cannot modify a string literal
Correct: Segmentation Fault
4. Prediction: Error because pointer fifth has become a constant
Result: error: read only var is not assignable


B.
1. Valid: char *chimpanzee = "animal"; char giraffe[8] = "animal";
char elephant[10];
elephant = "animal";
2. Valid declarations differ: have appropriate space to store the characters in the array, initialized the string.
3. When we switch fox and giraffe, unexpected behavior might happen, elements of fox will go to the end of giraffe because there’s extra space?


C.
1. strlen (computerscience): 9
strlen (isawesome): 15
computerscience: isawesome
isawesome: computerscience
2. Done
3. Correct
4. strlen(computerscience): 0
computerscience: (unexpected behavior)
5. Correct
6. Prediction: Concatenate the strings: computerscienceisawesome
Correct
If change isawesome bound to 32, print null in between two strings
Result: it ignore the null character
The strcat func connects the strings together, and ignore the null


D.
stringreverse.c


E.
1.
1. man string
2. man strcmp. Two different ways to compare 2 strings: strcmp or strncmp
3. const char *s1 and const char *s2 and size_t n
4. strcat appends the src string to the destination string, overwriting terminating null byte.
2.
1. Done
2. Error: redefinition of array size


Wednesday
A.
1. The program print:
1. arg 0: ./args
arg 1: +
arg 2: 4.0
arg 3: 4.5
2. arg 0: ./args
arg 1: sum
arg 2: text
arg 3: 2
3. arg 0: ./args
arg 1: encrypt
arg 2: “This message”
2. 
* The purpose of atoi is converting the initial portion of the string pointed to by nptr to int.
* The purpose of strtod is converting the initial portion of the string pointed to by nptr to double, float, and long double representation.


Friday
A.
1. Done
2. Done
3. Done
4. Done
5. It says bad address. Done
6. Prediction: We use fprintf instead of perror because we want to customize the error message.
When we try compiling and running it, it adds a ‘success’ message.
7. Done
8. Done


B.
1. Done
